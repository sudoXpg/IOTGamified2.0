# 🎮 IOTGamified 2.0 – Create Your Own Game Controller!
Welcome to **IOTGamified 2.0**, hosted by the **IOTHINC club of VIT Vellore**! In this exciting two-day workshop, participants will learn how to create their own **game controllers** from scratch using **ESP modules** and a custom **Python script** to communicate via the **UDP protocol**. Get ready to dive into the world of IoT, microcontrollers, sensors, and networking, and build something fun and interactive! 🌟

## 💻 Installation Guide
### **For Beginners – Setting Up Your Environment** 🎉

We'll be working with the following tools. Make sure to have them installed before the event for a smooth start!

### 1. **VS Code**
[Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install it. This will be our main editor for coding the ESP and Python scripts.

### 2. **Python**
- Download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Make sure to check the box for "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
- Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
  to verify installation.

### 3. **Arduino IDE**
Download and install the **Arduino IDE** from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). We'll use this to program the ESP module.

### 4. **vgamepad (Python library)**
To simulate a game controller using Python, install the `vgamepad` library:
  ```bash
  pip install vgamepad
  ```

### 5. **socket (Python library)**
For handling UDP communication, install the `socket` library:
  ```bash
  pip install sockets
  ```

Now you're ready to start coding and building your game controller! 🎮

## 🎉 See You at IOTGamified 2.0! 🎉
We can't wait to see what amazing game controllers you build! Make sure to come with your energy and curiosity! 💡 If you have any questions or issues with setup, feel free to reach out to the event organizers. 🚀
